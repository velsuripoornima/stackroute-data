id is string because of the following

from: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/1.3.3.RELEASE/reference/html/mapping-chapter.html
* If a field named 'id' is declared as a String or BigInteger in the Java class it will be converted to and stored as an ObjectId if possible. ObjectId as a field type is also valid. If you specify a value for 'id' in your application, the conversion to an ObjectId is delected to the MongoDBdriver. If the specified 'id' value cannot be converted to an ObjectId, then the value will be stored as is in the document's _id field.
* If a field named ' id' id field is not declared as a String, BigInteger, or ObjectID in the Java class then you should assign it a value in your application so it can be stored 'as-is' in the document's _id field.
* If no field named 'id' is present in the Java class then an implicit '_id' file will be generated by the driver but not mapped to a property or field of the Java class.
